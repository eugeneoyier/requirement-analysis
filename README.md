# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository documents the **Requirement Analysis Project**, which focuses on building a strong foundation for software development through clear, structured, and well-documented requirements.  

The project simulates a real-world booking management system scenario and highlights the importance of requirement gathering, analysis, and documentation within the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  

By completing this project, the goal is to:  
- Understand and apply the principles of requirement analysis.  
- Identify and structure both functional and non-functional requirements.  
- Create detailed documentation and diagrams (using tools like Draw.io) to illustrate system requirements.  
- Define acceptance criteria that align with business and user needs.  
- Follow industry-standard practices to ensure clarity, precision, and scalability.  

This repository will evolve into a **comprehensive blueprint of the requirement analysis phase**, serving as the foundation for successful project execution in real-world development.
